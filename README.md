## What This is
Unsure about how healthy you're eating? Not enough time to go to the doctor? Need quick advice on your daily diet? This is the app for you! In three simple clicks, you'll be given feedback on your lifestyle and some friendly advice.

## Why it Works
The user will input their eating habits for each meal into an HTML form via radio buttons that offer four choices per meal. They can do this anytime, but January is highly recommended after Christmas decadence.
The simple data input allows for immediate feedback, which is provided within the cheerful environment of our output page.
We include a range of serious to non-serious photo and textual content to make the experience fun and approachable.

## How it Works
Each of the meal's four possible choices is assigned a health value from 1 to 4 (1 being the unhealthiest and 4 being the healthiest). The app calculates the user's total as a percentage of the maximum possible score.

## Stretch Goals
* Clickable pictures
